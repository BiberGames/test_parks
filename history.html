        <h1>The History of ActionMC</h1>
        Chapter 1: Humble Beginnings <br />
        It all started when Action_Retro (Sean) decided to open a Minecraft™ 1.2.5 server for people with old PPC macs to enjoy. It was also made as part of the PPC challenge that is made, every year, in January, by the Mac Yak community (in which participants must do as much things of their everyday computing needs on a PPC mac). At first the server was kept private for some time so things could be set up and tuned. Notably in this period the server run on an Apple PowerMac G5® so it needed particular attention to avoid having lag issues, and avoid crashes. In this stage some minor builds were made, most notably Action_Retro's house and PowerMac G4 Cube builds which can still be found in the old spawn.
        <br />
        <br />
        Chapter 2: The Server Goes Public <br />
        In the first days of January 2021, the server finally went public after a lot of waiting. This event was marked by Action_Retro releasing a video announcing that.
        <br />
        <br />
        Turning a PowerMac G5 into a Retro Minecraft Server!

        <br />
        <br />
        In this period most of what will become the server's most active user base joined for the first time and started working on various projects.
        <br />
        <br />
        At this point in time, the server still ran on Action_Retro's PowerMac G5 and the server experienced various little tweaks to help with the tps and lag issues. Also, some important build limitations were missing, so for example, there were things like people placing stuff like end portal blocks all over the server. Eventually these events made the server adopt some more build limitations to prevent those annoyances, notably the server didn't yet adopt the usage of the Essentials suite of server or coreprotect plugins.
        <br />
        <br />
        Also in this stage of the server's life there wasn't any server website or whitelist management systems, so people who wanted to get whitelisted needed to go to Action_Retro's discord server and ask.
        <br />
        <br />
        We also see the most rapid development of builds at this time, notably most of the most important builds in that area were built. Stuff like the giant AMD Ryzen CPU, the specs wall, Mac Pro park, the Steve Jobs spawn portrait, the rainbow road, many Apple product builds at spawn, and more.
        <br />
        <br />
        This also marks the invention of the parks concept. The first successful follower of this concept was Mac Pro Park, which was just structures of all the generations of Mac Pro in block form. This worked pretty well for both longevity and also proved to be a nice landmark for people passing through. Many people iterated on their concept, and many parks of different themes began to pop up around the park.
        <br />
        <br />
        Also some of the big long lasting build projects were started, here are a few of the most important ones:
        <br />
        <br />
        <lu>
            <li>iMacG5, GalaxyC3, and TwentyTwentyHoe started working on the Parks, starting with the iMac Park. This project was changed at the last minute to decade themed parks, the first of which being the 2000's park.</li>
            <br />
            <li>ITzTravelInTime started what will become the stadium city project with the stadium build (that probably is still one of the largest builds on the server made without world edit to this very day), in particular for this very first major build he was helped by people like Bran5184 and Stasieq because of the massive amount of blocks that needed to be placed by hand.</li>
            <br />
            <li>The construction of the ministry of transportation building lead to the first steps of the development of what will become the Macton city, which is one of the most impressive build projects on the server, featuring lots of realistically made skyscrapers and city infrastructure.</li>
            <br />
